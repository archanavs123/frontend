                <h5>Style of Food</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify ;">By and large, South Indian cuisine is  the hottest of all Indian food. Meals are centered around rice or rice-based dishes. Rice is combined with sambar and rasam, dry and curried vegetables, meat dishes, and a host of coconut-based chutneys and popadums<br><a href="https://www.chefspencil.com/30-popular-south-indian-foods-and-desserts/">link1</a></p>

                <h5>Staple South Indian Foods</h5> 
                <p>No South Indian meal is complete without rice in some form or other. It’s either boiled rice or idlis (steamed cakes made from rice batter), dosas, or uttapams (pancakes made from a batter of rice and lentil flour). Daals (lentils) are also a part of most meals.<br><a href="https://www.chefspencil.com/30-popular-south-indian-foods-and-desserts/">link2</a></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">South Indian cuisine usually encompasses the five Southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Telangana, and Kerala. Both the geography and cultural influence of the South has an influence on the region's cuisine. As with most countries, there are large regional differences and each state's cuisine can vary greatly even within a specific state. There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. Additionally, all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well-known in their respective region.
           South India has a hot, humid climate and all its states are coastal. Rainfall is abundant and so is the supply of fresh fruit, vegetables, and rice. Andhra Pradesh produces fiery Andhra cuisine which is largely vegetarian yet has a huge range of seafood in its coastal areas. Tamilnadu has Chettinad cuisine, perhaps the fieriest of all Indian food. This style too is largely vegetarian.
            From Kerala comes Malabari cooking, with its repertoire of tasty seafood dishes. Hyderabad is the home of the Nizams (rulers of Hyderabad) and regal Nizami food rich and flavorful with tastes ranging from spicy to sour to sweet. Hyderabadi food is full of nuts, dried fruits, and expensive spices like saffron.</p>
